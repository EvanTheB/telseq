TelSeq is a software that estimates telomere length from 
whole genome sequencing data (BAMs). 

The most current development version is always available from our
git repository:
git://github.com/zd1/telseq.git


EXAMPLE USAGE
============================
The software can be run straightaway after download as a command line 
tool. 

Analysing a single BAM
---------------------------------
python run.py --name mysample1 --output-dir tests/ tests/test.1.bam
 
Analysing a list of BAMs 
---------------------------------
In this mode, paths of the BAMs should listed in a text file, i.e. 
named bamlist in the following examples
TelSeq can be run in the following two ways:
(1). Analyse BAMs sequentially (may take a very long time)
python run.py --bams tests/bamlist --output-dir tests/
 
(2). Analyse BAMs in parallel, i.e. on a computing cluster. Each run 
requires an index number, ranging from 1 to the total number of BAMs, 
indicating which BAM in the bamlist to be analysed. 
# To analyse the 1st BAM in the bamlist tests/bamlist
python run.py --index 1  --bams tests/bamlist --output-dir tests/

# And don't forget to merge them after all runs are completed. 
python run.py --merge --bams tests/bamlist --output-dir tests/

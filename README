TelSeq is a software that estimates telomere length from 
whole genome sequencing data (BAMs). 

The most current development version is always available from our
git repository:
git://github.com/zd1/telseq.git


EXAMPLE USAGE
============================

# Single BAM analysis
---------------------------------
python run.py --name mysample1 -o tests/ tests/test.1.bam

# Multi BAM analysis
---------------------------------
# For a list of BAM files that are listed in a text file, i.e. bamindex
# TelSeq can be run in the following two ways:
# 1. They can be run sequentially (may take a very long time)
python run.py --bams tests/bamindex -o tests/

# 2. They can also be run in parallelly, with a index number (from 1 to 
# the total number of BAMs)
python run.py --index 1  --bams tests/bamindex -o tests/

# After the above run has finished, output from each run can be merged by 
# the following command
python run.py --merge --bams tests/bamindex -o tests/

TelSeq is a software that estimates telomere length from 
whole genome sequencing data (BAMs). 

The most current development version is available from our
git repository:
git://github.com/zd1/telseq.git

The software is implemented in C++. 

We also have a Python implementation. But it is not updated anymore.
You could switch to branch 'python' use the 'branch' button above 
and follow the instruction there.


Compiling TelSeq
============================

TelSeq dependency:
--------------------------------
- the bamtools library (https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools)


Compiling
---------------------------

./configure && make
The executable binary will be at src/Telseq/telseq


If bamtools are installed not at the system location, you can 
specify their location by 
./configure  --with-bamtools=/path/to/bamtools

The /path/to/bamtools directory is the directory that contains 'lib' and 'include' sub directories. 


Running TelSeq
=============================

# Analyse one or more BAMs 
> telseq a.bam b.bam 

# Analyse a list of BAMs specified in a 'bamlist' file. 

bamlist should contains only 1 column, with each row the path of a BAM. i.e. 
bamlist:
/path/to/a.bam
/path/to/b.bam

> telseq -f bamlist

# Use pipe to provide a list of BAM files 
cat bamlist | telseq

The result files will be named as BAM file name with 'bamscan' suffix, i.e. 
for a.bam, it will be a.bam.bamscan. 

# By default the headers of the result files are suppressed, thus the results 
can be combined by 

> cat a.bam.bamscan b.bam.bamscan  >> all.bamscan

TelSeq is a software that estimates telomere length from 
whole genome sequencing data (BAMs). 

The most current development version is available from our
git repository:
git://github.com/zd1/telseq.git

The software is implemented in C++. 

We also have a Python implementation. But it is not updated anymore.
You could switch to branch 'python' using the 'branch' button above 
and follow the instructions there.


Compiling TelSeq
============================

TelSeq dependency:
--------------------------------
- the bamtools library (https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools)


Compiling
---------------------------

./configure && make
The executable binary will be at src/Telseq/telseq


If bamtools are installed not at the system location, you can 
specify their location by 
./configure  --with-bamtools=/path/to/bamtools

The /path/to/bamtools directory is the directory that contains 'lib' and 'include' sub directories. 


Running TelSeq
=============================

# Read options and usage information 
---------------------------
> telseq

# Analyse one or more BAMs by specifying BAM file path as command line arguments.
---------------------------
> telseq a.bam b.bam 

# Analyse a list of BAMs whose paths are specified in a 'bamlist' file. 
---------------------------
bamlist should contains only 1 column with each row the path of a BAM. i.e. 

/path/to/a.bam
/path/to/b.bam

> telseq -f bamlist

# BAM file path can also be provided by piping in a 'bamlist', whose format must be 
# same as above 
---------------------------
> cat bamlist | telseq

# output
---------------------------
The result file will be named as the input BAM file name (without directories) 
with a 'bamscan' suffix, i.e. if the input BAM is '/path/to/a.bam', the result file will
be named as 'a.bam.bamscan'. 

By default, the output are stored in the current directory. This can be changed by using
'-o' option. 

> telseq -o /path/to/output a.bam b.bam c.bam

The result files will be
/path/to/output/a.bam.bamscan
/path/to/output/b.bam.bamscan
/path/to/output/c.bam.bamscan

# output file format
---------------------------
# By default the headers of the result files are suppressed, thus the results 
can be combined by 

> cat a.bam.bamscan b.bam.bamscan  >> all.bamscan
